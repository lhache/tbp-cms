<h2>Finding a gift for a one year old </h2>


You are looking for a fun and educational toy for a one year old? Don’t worry its not so hard as it seems. One year olds are in high development phase, they can’t fully speak just yet and learn are in the middle of the progress to understand their emotions. One-year-olds are just discovering their creative abilities. As one-year olds play, they start to build their mathematical thinking by recognizing patterns and understanding shapes. Some of the most obvious changes that you will notice in your child this year are in the area of physical development. Their gait is a bit awkward and clumsy and falls are common. They take pleasure in nursery rhymes and books with single pictures of familiar and related items. They begin to sort familiar objects by one characteristic, such as whether they are "hard" or "soft." They may enjoy filling and emptying containers.

Many can also do simple insert puzzles when the puzzle pieces show whole objects, so getting a one year old a puzzle might be a good way to go. They may apply their growing vocabularies by naming pictures in books read to them, which you could foster by getting them some small books with little texts. Children this age also have no understanding of true "writing," but many enjoy experimenting with marks and scribbles on a surface. Their interest in art is focused on the sensory exploration of art materials, such as paint and clay. With music, they can respond with their whole bodies to rhythm, beat and melody.  Hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity will also improve. Toddlers gain better control over fingers and hands and can explore toys and surroundings more than before. Look for toys that encourage this, as mastering age-appropriate toys and games gives toddlers a sense of satisfaction and encourages them to move on to more challenging tasks. Your toddler now is aware of the function of objects, so is more likely to stack blocks, listen or talk into a toy phone, or push a toy car. In addition, the concept of pretend play starts. Your little one may pretend to drink from an empty cup, use a banana as a phone, or imagine a block is a car.
